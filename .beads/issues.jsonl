Calendar Notification Pass-through\n- Mirror Google Calendar's notification settings from the API\n- Use system notifications (D-Bus / libnotify on Fedora KDE)\n- Show meeting title, time, and attendees in notification\n- Click notification to open Quinoa and select that meeting\n\n### 2. Recording Reminder\n- If a meeting has started (based on calendar time) and recording hasn't begun:\n  - Show a **persistent** notification (user must dismiss)\n  - 'Your meeting \"Weekly 1:1\" started 2 minutes ago. Start recording?'\n  - **Action button: 'Start Recording'** - starts recording directly from notification\n  - No repeated reminders, just one persistent notification\n- Configurable grace period in settings\n\n### 3. Settings\n- Toggle: Enable/disable meeting notifications\n- Toggle: Enable/disable recording reminders  \n- Toggle: Notify for all meetings vs only meetings with video links (Meet/Zoom/Teams)\n- Configure reminder delay (how long after meeting start before warning)\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- Use D-Bus notifications for KDE integration (supports action buttons)\n- Fallback to QSystemTrayIcon.showMessage() for cross-platform\n- Poll calendar events via CalendarSyncWorker or dedicated NotificationWorker\n- Parse Google Calendar reminder settings from API response\n\n## Notification Flow\n1. Calendar sync pulls events with their reminder settings\n2. NotificationWorker schedules timers based on reminder times\n3. At reminder time: show system notification\n4. At meeting start + grace period: if not recording, show persistent 'Start Recording?' notification\n5. User clicks 'Start Recording' → Quinoa starts recording for that meeting\n\n## Sub-tasks\n- [ ] Research D-Bus notification API for KDE (with action buttons)\n- [ ] Add notification settings to SettingsDialog\n- [ ] Create NotificationWorker to schedule/trigger notifications\n- [ ] Implement pre-meeting reminder notifications\n- [ ] Implement 'recording not started' persistent warning\n- [ ] Add 'Start Recording' action button handler\n- [ ] Parse Google Calendar reminder settings from sync\n- [ ] Store notification preferences in config","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-09T14:49:01.349216731-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-09T14:55:40.887700957-05:00"}
