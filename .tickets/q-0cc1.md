# Collapsible recording toolbar

The mic selector, VU meters, record/pause/transcribe buttons at the bottom of the middle panel take significant space even when just reviewing past meetings. Group these into a collapsible toolbar that expands when relevant (recording state) and collapses to a compact bar when reviewing notes/transcripts.
