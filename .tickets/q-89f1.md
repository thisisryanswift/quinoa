# Two-line list items (title + date/indicators)

Redesign meeting list items to use two lines: Line 1 for the meeting title (truncated less aggressively with more width), Line 2 for date, duration, and status indicators (has transcript, has notes) in a lighter/smaller font. This is the standard pattern used by email clients and chat apps for information-dense lists.
