# UI Polish & Layout Overhaul

Overhaul the Quinoa UI based on UX audit findings. The app currently reads as a utility rather than a product. Key issues: aggressive text truncation in the left panel, missing empty states, poor information hierarchy, dense list spacing, and recording controls that dominate when not relevant. Goal: make the three-panel layout feel cohesive and information-rich.

## Acceptance Criteria

Left panel items are readable without truncation. Empty states exist for middle and right panels. VU meters hidden when not recording. Date context visible in meeting list.
