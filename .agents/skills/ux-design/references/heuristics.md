# Modern Desktop Aesthetic & UX Heuristics

## The "Modern" Aesthetic (Taste)

When evaluating screenshots, prioritize these visual traits:

1.  **Subtle Contrast:** Avoid pure black (#000) on white (#FFF) or vice versa. Use deep grays and off-whites for a softer look.
2.  **Corner Radii:** Prefer consistent, medium rounding (e.g., 6px to 12px) for buttons, cards, and windows.
3.  **Shadows over Borders:** Use soft, diffused drop shadows (Elevation) instead of high-contrast borders to define depth.
4.  **Information Hierarchy:** Use font weights (Medium/Bold) and color (Primary vs. Secondary text) instead of font size alone to show importance.
5.  **Whitespace (The Secret Sauce):** Ensure consistent "breathing room" around elements. If it feels "cluttered," increase the layout's internal margins.

## Usability Heuristics (Function)

1.  **Consistency:** Does this button look like other buttons in the app? Do same-actions have the same icons?
2.  **Feedback:** Is it clear when a button is clicked or a process is running (e.g., progress bars, loading states)?
3.  **Efficiency:** Can the most common task be done in 1-2 clicks?
4.  **Error Prevention:** Are destructive actions (Delete, Reset) visually distinct (e.g., red) and require confirmation?
5.  **Visibility of Status:** Is the user always aware of what the app is doing (e.g., "Syncing...", "Recording...")?
